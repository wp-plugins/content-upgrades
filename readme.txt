Use this plugin to create content upgrades, which require your readers to subscribe to your email list to get access to the bonus materials.

== Description ==

Content Upgrades plugin will help you to create "content specific bonuses" in your articles, that people have to opt in for.

**How does it work?**

1. The plugin gives you a shortcode that you can use to create a basic text link anywhere in the text of your article.

2. Once your visitors click that text link, a popup will appear, asking them to leave their email address.

3. Once they submit their email address, they will get redirected to the page of your choice.
