<h2>You're using the free version</h2>
The free version of Content Upgrades plugin does not support creating additional content upgrades.<br/><br/>
What you can do though, is customise the text of your popup on each page where you use it.<br/> 
Look for the box called “Content Upgrade Options” in your post editor (it’s right under the box where you write your content):<br/><br/>  
<img src="<?php echo  plugin_dir_url(__FILE__)?>res/notice_scr.png"/>
<br/><br/><h3><strong>Please also consider upgrading to a PRO version.</strong></h3>
You can learn more about it on the official website:<br/>
